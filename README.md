# CMPE-195A-Senior-Project
A year long semester project for CMPE 195A/E and CMPE 195B/F at SJSU. 

## Project Setup

Copy the code from GitHub using git clone

Once you open up the project, cd into /grocer-brochure/ in your terminal

Then install the modules from package.json
### `npm install`

Assuming all the modules have been successfully installed, run:
### `npm run start`

If the database hasn't already been created, the above command will create 'GrocerBrochure.db'

Next, populate the database by navigating to /grocer-brochure/server/db in your terminal

Make sure you have python installed and set in your relevant PATH variable. Run the following
### `python Database.py`

If you see 'done' in your terminal, the seeding was performed successfully.

Start the project again with 'npm run start' (or refresh the page if you still had the program running)

Once done, you should be able to interact with the website on localhost:3000
